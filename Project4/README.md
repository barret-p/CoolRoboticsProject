## Project 4  
### Project Description:  

The simulated 4-wheel vehicle uses the Ackerman Steering model. In the track panel there is an overall view of the entire track with the vehicle represented as a red dot. In the middle, there is a blownup view of the track and a detailed version of the vehicle that shows the steering angle of the front wheels. In the vehicle drive panel on the side there is a steering wheel that you can drag around with the mouse to steer the vehicle. Right below the steering wheel is the control for the velocity of the front right wheel, you can also use the '-' and '+' keys on the keyboard. There is also a representation of the vehicle that indicates the calculated velocities of each of the wheels as well as the overall velocity of the vehicle. Pressing 'r' on the keyboard will start recording the vehicle and leave a trail of its path on the overall map, press 'r' again to stop recording. If you try to record a new path, the previously recorded path will be removed. Pressing 'p' on the keyboard will play back the path that the vehicle took, when it reaches the end of the recording, the vehicle pauses. Press 'p' again at any point to go back to user controlled mode. There are indicatrs at the bottom of the vehicle drive panel to indicate the current state.  

### To run the program:  
There is a standalone Driving Simulator.exe that you can run in the build folder.  
You need the whole folder in order to run the Driving Simulator.exe.  

If you want to look at the code, the main script is Driving Simulator/Assets/Scripts/VehicleController.cs  
If you want to make changes to the prject, then you would need to install Unity ver. 2019.2.2f1 (64-bit) and open the Driving Simulator folder as a project in Unity.
