### Project Description:  

The simulated robot arm is a RRR arm with a paint brush on the end. The CCW and CW buttons for each joint rotate the corresponding joint by 1 degree in the corrsponding direction. There is also a slider underneather each set of buttons that corresponds to a rotation, so the slider essentially goes from -180 degrees to 180 degrees. There is a paint button that only paints the current position of the brush and a paint checkbox that toggles the paint brush to continuously paint. There is an undo button to remove the most recent paint mark. There is a clear button that removes all the paint from the screen. By default the brush color is black, but the Red, Green, and Blue buttons will set the brush to that color. You can also put in values for RGB in the text boxes and press the custom button to make the brush any RGB color.  
### To run the program:  
Make sure python 3.5 or higher is installed.  
Type "python -m pip install PyQt5" into the cmd console to install the required graphics library.  
Navigate to the folder containing "project1.py" in your console and type "python project1.py".  
It should run the program and come up with the GUI.
